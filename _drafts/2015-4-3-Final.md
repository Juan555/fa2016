### Proposal Due - *April 10*, 2015, 11.59PM CST
### Prototype Presentation Due - *April 19*, 2015, 11.59PM CST
### Final Presentation Date - *May 11*, 2015, 8.00AM CST

###Overview

Your goal is to **create a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API** with the following constraints:

1. Your team may only consist of 3-4 people, with each person having a **specific** role.
2. Your project must be a web application that has a frontend, an API, JavaScript backend, and at least one database.
3. Your project needs to have user authentication.
4. Your project needs to have a heuristic evaluation with at least one revision. Make sure you plan time for this.
5. Your project must have a strong focus on design, primarily in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and responsiveness.

###Part A: Proposal

**Due - *April 10*, 2015, 11.59PM CST**

Email a **one-page** PDF proposal to [uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com](mailto:uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com) containing the following:

+ Team Members (Names and NetIDs)
+ Problem Statement & Motivation
+ Solution Approach
+ Technologies used for front end & back end
+ Specific breakdown of what each team member is responsible for

###Part B: Prototype Presentation

**Due Date: April 19, 2015, 11.59PM CST**

**Presentations: April 20 and April 22 (in class)**

Each team will be given five minutes to present the following in class:

+ The problem they are solving
+ Demo of their solution (webapp) using a [powerpoint prototype](http://boxesandarrows.com/interactive-prototypes-with-powerpoint/).

###Part C: Final Presentation

**Due Date - *May 11*, 2015, 8.00AM CST**

On the day of your final presentation, your overall deliverables are:

+ Source Code for the Project / URL to GitHub Repository
+ URL to your hosted project
+ Approximately 5-minute video detailing your web app's purpose, design, and functionality
+ ~~Your powerpoint deck~~
+ Peer evaluation

Your presentation will be 5 minutes for the video and 2 minutes for Q&amp;A.

####Video Requirements
+ 5-minutes length max
+ Should focus on design and functionality
+ Use screen capture software (SnagIt/ScreenFlow (Mac)/Camstasia/Quicktime) 
+ Demo the important user flows
+ Voice-over should tell a concrete story: user, problem, and how your app solves it
+ Communicate the motivation behind design decisions (e.g. _how did heuristic evaluation play a role in changes that were made to the interface?_)

###Grade Breakdown

+ Proposal: 5%
+ Prototype Presentation: 10%
+ Final Presentation (Video): 10%
+ Design (UX and UI): 15%
+ Heuristic Evaluation: 10%
+ Front end: 25%
+ Back end (API, server, database): 25%

###Submission Instructions
+ Each team should fill up the [project submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1brvBOy84rnTvGwEir4xpO7oTl_bgDxOTmSnIcU-v7r8/viewform?usp=send_form)
+ Each team member should fill up the [peer evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QIUinkORsJF0xZMcfuVnfFQdav7lU4SUZHx8atQ3sCw/viewform?usp=send_form)

**Note**: There will be a final competition separate from the grading that will be judged on novelty and usefulness of app. Top teams would be publicized.
