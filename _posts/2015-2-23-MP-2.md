### Due Date - March 11, 2015, 11.59PM CST

###Overview
In this programming assignment you will make your single-page website responsive, improve its visual design, and implement a seperate front-end interface using AngularJS. The assignment is broken down into three parts and an additional extra credit part. Part C is independent of Parts A and B and can be worked on without completing part A or B. Also, please read all parts before you work on this MP as there might be a potential for saving work by being creative.

You can use the development environment and server setup you used for MP 1. Refer to Lab 2 for details about the MP 2 starter code. 

###Part A: Responsive Design
For this part, you are to implement your webpage from MP 1 using the [Foundation front-end framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) from the ground up. This is so that you can make your webpage responsive and can use some of the other components (say naviagtion bar) that foundation provides.

Please adhere to the following rules for this part:

1. Keep the content the same as your MP 1 webpage. 
+ You should not be using css/scss/javascript that is written from scratch (including your scss and javascript that you developed for MP 1).
+ Responsiveness: Your webpage needs to be responsive and have visible changes when going from large to medium and medium to small screen sizes. These changes have to be intentional and well thought out. You will have to submit a writeup that lists these changes (at least three) and the rationale behind them.
+ You are free to use any component that Foundation provides (such as buttons, drop-down menus etc.) if it makes sense for your website. The [Foundation documentation page](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) lists all such components on the left side of the page.
+ You are free to use any third party plugins or libraries as you deem fit. For example, you can implement your carousel using [Slick Carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).
+ You will get full credit for this part even if you do not change the default styles of foundation components and other libraries.

###Part B: Visual Design
For this part, you are to improve the visual design of the webpage from Part A. Here are some specific things you can do:

1. Take your peer feedback from MP 1 into account to identify areas of visual design that needs to be improved for your website. Examples of these could be better layout, better color schemes, better typography etc. You will have to submit a writeup that lists these areas (at least three) and how you improved them.
+ To get to your intended visual design, modify the default style of Foundation components by modifying the foundation scss files in `public/foundation/scss`. Also, the [Foundation documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) for each component tell you what to change in the sass files to change the styling of that component.
+ Additional styles that you need can then be added to the scss files in `scss` folder like you did in MP 1.
+ Overall, implement a consistent theme throughout the website. For example, you should:
	* use the same (two or three) fonts throughout the website
	+ have the same color scheme throughout the website
	+ have similar whitespacing for different elements


###Part C: AngularJS Front-End Design
For this part, you are to create a single-page AngularJS app that lets users interact with the data from the [IMDB top 250 movies](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top). We have provided you the data in JSON format in `public/data/imdb250.json` along with poster images for the movies in `public/data/images`. The images are named using the `imdbID` for each movies. 

You should create a new HTML page at `public/imdb250.html` and write your AngularJS code in the `js` folder (your controllers can go in `js/controllers.js` for example). 

Your app should have the following features:

1. Two different list views of the data. The first one should list all the movie names. The second one should display all the movie thumbnails. 
+ Both views should have a search bar that would help filter the names in the list. It should filter the list as you type.
+ Both views should have a list of categories that allows the users to further narrow down the search results. 
+ When any of the items in the list views is clicked, complete information about that movie should appear. This view should have previous and next buttons (can be implemented with arrows) and should work with keyboard arrow buttons. Also, this view should only show you movies that were in the shortened list after applying search and categories selection inputs to the entire list. There should also be a way to go back to the list view.

You can see a demo of a sample app in the video below:

Also, here is a list of angular components that you might find useful

* [ngApp](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp)
+ [ngController](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngController)
+ [ngModel](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel)
+ [ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat)
+ [filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$filter)
+ [orderBy](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/orderBy)
+ [$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http)

For the complete list, please refer to the [Angular documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng).
 

###Part D: Extra Credit
1. Load data for your website (Part B) from a JSON file using AngularJS. 
+ Implement another view for Part C that lets you explore the data in a different way. You can be creative about this and think about how you go about searching for a movie to watch.

###Rules
1.	This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is permitted.
+   It is not permitted to copy/paste code that is not your own. You are, however, free to look at different code sources for inspiration and clarity. All sources (code as well as reading material) that you reference to complete this assignment must be declared in the submission.
+ If you think something you're doing might not be acceptable, please ask on Piazza.

###Grade Breakdown

1. 	Part A: Responsive Design - 30%
This part will be graded mainly based on the responsiveness of your design and the correct use of foundation components and other libraries. Visual design and style will not be a part of this grade.
+ Part B: Visual Design - 30%
This part will be graded mainly on visual design.
+ Part C: AngularJS Front-End Design - 40%
This part will be graded on functionality that is implemented and not on the visual design.
+ Part D: Extra Credit - 10% (5% for each part)


###Submission Details
1. Use [this form]() to submit your MP.
2. Make sure you set your Github repo to public two days after the deadline.
