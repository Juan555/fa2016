###Overview
In this programming assignment, you will design and impelement a single-page website with specified functionality and formatting using only HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The content of the website is up to you. For example, the subject can be a company/organization, a product, or simply a personal/portfolio page. Through this assignment, you will be tested on your use of structured semantics present in HTML5 (e.g. header, canvas, video), CSS3 styling complexity (e.g. use of webfonts, animations, layout), and overall design as discussed in class.

###Required Features 
Your webpage has to have the following features:

1. All content within a single page
2. Full-width horizontal stripes/sections layout including a header and a footer
3.	Navigation bar which sticks to the top of the window when scrolling
4.	Smooth scrolling when navigating to a different section using the navigation bar
5.	Indicator of the current reading position visible in the navigation bar
6.	Header section with a carousel/slider using a minimum of three slides	
7.  A section with Multi-column content
8.	A section which has horizontally and vertically centered content
9.	A section which uses a fixed-position background image
10.	A section which uses modal windows with additional content
11.	Embedded content (e.g. video, map)
12.	At least one use of CSS3 animations (e.g. fade in/out, transitions)
13.	At least one use of scalable vector icons through CSS (e.g. FontAwesome)
14.	Inclusion of social media icons

###Rules
1.	This is an individual assignment. So, please do not collaborate with others.
2.	There must be no use of content management systems, or frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, Pure CSS, Foundation, etc.)
3.	HTML tables cannot be used for layout	
4.	The only Javascript framework which can be used is jQuery
5.	The website must be servable through the provided GRUNT-based virtual machine
6.	SASS/SCSS principles must be utilized (e.g. mix-ins, variables). Technically you can write plain CSS in SCSS files. That is not what we want.
7.  If you think something you're doing might not be acceptable, please ask on Piazza.
