<span class="section-heading">Overview</span>

Your goal is to **create a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API** with the following constraints:

1. Your team may only consist of 3-4 people, with each person having a **specific** role.
2. Your project must be a web application that has a frontend, an API, JavaScript backend, and at least one database.
3. Your project needs to have user authentication.
4. Your project needs to have a heuristic evaluation with at least one revision. Make sure you plan time for this.
5. Your project must have a strong focus on design, primarily in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and responsiveness.

<span class="section-heading">Part A: Proposal</span>

<span style="color: red">**Due - *Feb 24*, 2016, 11.59PM CST**</span>

Email a **one-page** PDF proposal to [uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com](mailto:uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com) containing the following:

+ Team Name
+ Team Members (Names and NetIDs)
+ Problem Statement & Motivation
+ Solution Approach
+ Technologies used for front end & back end
+ Specific breakdown of what each team member is responsible for
+ 

<span class="section-heading">Part B: Paper Prototypes</span>

<span style="color: red">**Due - *March 30*, 2016, In Class**</span>

During class, teams will perform heuristic evaluations of each other's paper prototypes and give feedback.

Paper prototypes should capture at least three of the key interactions in your team's web app. The paper prototypes can be done digitally (using software like powerpoint or balsamiq), but should be printed and brought to class. During class, the TAs will be walking around grading prototypes for quality and completion.
