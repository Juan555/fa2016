### Due Date - *May 1*, 2015, 11.59PM CST

<span style="color: red">Attention:</span> This is a make-up programming assignment. If completed, your grade on this MP will replace your lowest existing MP grade. This assignment should not be considered extra credit and will not give you extra points on the midterm or the class overall.

<span style="color: red">Attention:</span> **We will not be providing any starter code for this MP**. It is up to you to learn how to use this framework, organize your files, bundle them, ensure that a README is included, and that it is properly committed to a private repository (shared to **uiuc-web-programming**). Please ensure that your Meteor app builds and runs properly in your Vagrant/NodeJS development environment.

###Meteor

Many optimizations are possible using the Meteor framework for this task manager system. The primary benefits (which you will need to incorporate) are listed below:

1. Applications built in Meteor are real-time by default. Two instances of your app will have the DOM updated automatically.
+ Meteor does not use data-bindings or controllers as Angular would. This should make the front-end significantly simpler.
+ There is no need to create or call API endpoints. Meteor seamlessly synchronizes data on the client and the server.
+ Query-string functionality is already implemented using Meteor collections.
+ Live-editing of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files are automatically updated in the browser. This is great for webapps with continuous development after deployment.
+ Meteor makes extensive use of templating, but in addition to templating variables, Meteor supports templated callback functions which can then change the DOM.
+ Meteor allows you to immediately deploy your app to test on their servers using the "deploy" command.
+ After developing, you can bundle your code such that anyone with a Node.JS server could download your webapp and instantly run it.

It is <span style="color: red">strongly</span> suggested that you watch the following video to see all the benefits of Meteor in action!

###Requirements

Your goal is to **recreate the User-Task management system of MP 3 using the Meteor framework**. Follow [these exact instructions](https://www.meteor.com/install) to get started with building your Meteor app from scratch. While there is no stylistic requirements for your webapp, the overall functionality must remain exactly the same.

####User Schema

1. "name" - String
+ "email" - String
+ "pendingTasks" - [String] - The _id fields of the *pending* tasks that this user has
+ "dateCreated" - Date - should be set automatically by server

####Task Schema

1. "name" - String
+ "description" - String
+ "deadline" - Date
+ "completed" - Boolean
+ "assignedUser" - String - The _id field of the user this task is assigned to - default ""
+ "assignedUserName" - String - The name field of the user this task is assigned to - default "unassigned"
+ "dateCreated" - Date - should be set automatically by server to present date 

####Views

1. User List:
	+ List **all** user names (20 at a time using pagination). Clicking on a user should take us to the User Details view.
	+ Have next and previous buttons. 
	+ Have a button to create a new user that takes you to Add User view. 
	+ Have a sort-by dropdown menu with appropriate options (name, dateCreated) and ascending/descending radio buttons.
	+ Have a delete button next to each displayed user
+ Task List:
	+ List task names (use pagination to display only 10 at a time) with the name of the assigned user next to it. Clicking on a task should take us to the Task Details view.
	+ Have an input (for example radio buttons) to show "All", "Completed" or "Pending" tasks. By default it should show the Pending tasks.
	+ Have next and previous buttons.
	+ Have a button to create a new task that takes you to Add Task view.
	+ Have a sort-by dropdown menu with appropriate options (name, username, dateCreated, deadline) and ascending/descending radio buttons.
	+ Have a delete button next to each displayed task.
+ User Details:
	+ Show details about the user (name, email).
	+ Have a edit user button that takes you to Edit User view.
	+ Show a list of pending tasks that the user has. 
	+ There should be a way to mark each task as complete. As soon as a task is marked as complete, it should dissapear from that list. Also, clicking on a task should take us to the Task Details view.
+ Task Details: 
	+ Show details about the task (name, description, assigned user, etc).
	+ Have a edit task button that takes you to Edit Task view.
	+ Have a way to change the completion status of the tasks.

####Modals

1. Add User:
	+ Use a form to collect a new user's name and email.
+ Add Task:
	+ Use a form to create a new task with a name, description, deadline, and a dropdown menu to choose an assigned user.

These modals should be accessible through buttons in the User List and Task List, respectively. After succesfully adding a user/task, the modal should disappear and an automatically-updated user/task list should appear in real-time.

You should have client side validation in both forms to ensure that:
	+ Users cannot be created (or updated) without a name or email. Also check for the validity of the email provided. These fields should be marked with a red * to indicate that they are required and an error message should pop up when users don't comply.
	+ Tasks cannot be created (or updated) without a name or a deadline. These fields should be marked with a red * to indicate that they are required and an error message should pop up when users don't comply.

####Server

You do still need to construct your own API server using Meteor.

###Submission Details

A submission form will be provided at a later date for you to submit a link to your Github repository with your complete webapp code. To deploy your Meteor app on our Node.JS server, first [create a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository) on Github with the name **mp4** without README/gitignore/licenses, then find the remote repository URL, then perform the following operations:

```
cd /path/to/your/webapp
meteor build --directory ./
mv bundle mp4
cd mp4
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'First commit of CS498RK MP4'
git remote add origin YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL
git remote -v
git push origin master
```

You should now have an `mp4` folder in your source directory which has been pushed to your Github **mp4** repository.
