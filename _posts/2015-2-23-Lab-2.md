1 - Open the terminal and point it to the `vagrant-dev` folder from MP 1.

2 - Fire up vagrant and ssh into it. Change directories to `\vagrant`.

```bash 
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd \vagrant
```

3 -  Clone the [MP2 starter kit repository](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp2_starter.git).
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp2_starter.git
```

4 - Install the necessary npm and bower modules, uglify the Javascript, compile the scss files and finally serve the sample webpage
```bash
npm install
bower install
grunt uglify
grunt compass
grunt
```

You shoud be able to see the sample webpage at `http://localhost:3000`. It uses both Foundation and AngularJS.

5 - To be able to debug AngularJS code in the chrome developer tools, you should install the [AngularJS Batarang (Stable)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang-stable/niopocochgahfkiccpjmmpchncjoapek) plugin. Some other AngularJS debugging tips can be found [in this article](http://ionicframework.com/blog/angularjs-console/)
