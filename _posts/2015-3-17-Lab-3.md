1 - Edit the Vagrantfile in the `vagrant-dev` folder to forward port 4000 of the guest machine to port 4000 of the host machine.

2 - Login to your virtual machine and install nodemon

```bash
cd vagrant-dev
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
npm install -g nodemon
```
**Server Side**

1 -  Go to your github account (or create one) and create a new repository named `mp3_server`. ***Set it to private***. [Create a duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) of the [MP-3 server starter code](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp3_server_starter) from the class github repo by using the commands below 

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp3_server_starter.git
cd mp3_server_starter.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/your-github-username/mp3_server.git
# Mirror-push to your mp3 server repository. 
# Use your github username in the URL. Change the URL if you're using bitbucket.
cd ..
rm -rf mp3_server_starter.git
```
Then clone it to your machine and inspect the files inside by using the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/mp3_server
cd mp3_server
```

2 - Install the necessary npm modules and run the server with nodemon

```bash
npm install #if you are on Windows use: npm install --no-bin-links
nodemon server.js
```

You shoud be able to a hello world message at `http://localhost:4000/api`. 

3 - You can then devlop your part A of MP locally and push chnages to your gihub. 

4 - If you use additional libraries, make sure that all such libraries get installed when we do `npm install` after cloning your MP 3 server code repo (this can be done by adding the libraries in the `packages.json`). 

**Creating a Database on Mongolab**

1 - Make an account on [Mongolab](https://mongolab.com)

2 - Log in and `create new` database. Under Plan choose `Single-node` and the default pricing plan. Give your database a name and create it.

3 - Click on the database. Under the Users tab create a new user. A box on top of the page should give you a URI like `mongodb://my_name:zebra@ds052337.mongolab.com:53937/mp3_3` that you can use in your server.js file to connect to the new database.

**Client Side**

1 -  Go to your github account (or create one) and create a new repository named `mp3_client`. ***Set it to private***. [Create a duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) of the [MP-3 client starter code](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp3_client_starter) from the class github repo by using the commands below 

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp3_client_starter.git
cd mp3_client_starter.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/your-github-username/mp3_client.git
# Mirror-push to your mp3 client repository. 
# Use your github username in the URL. Change the URL if you're using bitbucket.
cd ..
rm -rf mp3_client_starter.git
```
Then clone it to your machine and inspect the files inside by using the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/mp3_client
cd mp3_client
```

2 - Install the necessary npm and bower modules. Build the javascript and CSS files and run the server with grunt.

```bash
npm install #if you are on Windows use: npm install --no-bin-links
bower install
grunt compass:dev
grunt compass:foundation
grunt uglify
grunt
```
You shoud be able to see a barebones page at `http://localhost:3000`. In the settings tab you can set the base url for your API (such as `http://localhost:4000`) and then if you go to the List Llamas you should see the name of two llamas (assuming your server is running). The other two tabs are to show you how you can pass data between two controllers using a service calle `CommonData` that we have defined in `js/services.js` 

3 - You can then devlop your part B of MP locally and push chnages to your gihub. 

4 - If you use additional libraries, make sure that all such libraries get installed when we do `npm install` and `bower install` after cloning your MP 3 client code repo (this can be done by adding the libraries in the `packages.json` or `bower.json` file).
